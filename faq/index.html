		<h1><span>FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS</span></h1>

		<span class="highlight">How soon can I book an appointment to shoot?</span><br />

		We're generally booked a month or so in advance depending on the time of year. All of our clients have access to all available shoot dates through our online booking tool. We don't have a VIP list or fast track anybody.<br /> 

		<span class="highlight">Can I put my name on a waiting list for an earlier shoot?</span><br />

		While we don't keep a general waiting list, you will have the option to add your name to our internal list during the final step of the booking process. Our booking manager will contact you directly if an earlier shoot date opens up.<br /> 

		<span class="highlight">Do you shoot digital or film? </span><br />

		We shoot digital. <br />

		<span class="highlight">What do I get from my shoot?</span><br />

		You'll receive a link to a gallery of your shoot typically within five working days. The online proofs measure 1200 pixels at a resolution of 240 pixels per inch (PPI). <br />

		<span class="highlight">Will I get the high resolution raw files from my shoot?</span><br />

		No, we don't release the high resolution raw files, but we do offer retouching for $45 for a standard headshot retouch overseen and approved by Dana. By working directly with our professional retouchers, we make sure that your headshots reflect the same high quality as the photos on the walls of the studio, our social media pages and our website. For $10 per shot, our retouchers will provide you with an individually light balanced and color graded file for online use. <br />

		<span class="highlight">Do I need to book hair and makeup?</span><br />

		No, we'll arrange for our hair and makeup artist to work with you at the studio on each look throughout your shoot. See our booking page for hair and makeup rates.<br />

		<span class="highlight">Can I do my own hair and makeup or bring my own hair and makeup artist?</span><br />

		We partner with our hair and makeup artists to deliver the best possible results from your shoot, so we don't allow clients to opt out of studio hair and makeup. Our longstanding relationships with top H&MU professionals are critical to maintaining the studio's consistently high standards. Rest assured; we'll always make sure you're comfortable and happy with the makeup and styling before shooting each look. <br />

		<span class="highlight">Do we need to meet before the shoot?</span><br />

		No, it's not necessary to meet prior to your scheduled appointment. We'll send you the information you need to prepare well ahead of your shoot.<br />

		<span class="highlight">What should I wear?</span><br />

		We'll send you all information that you need to prepare well ahead of your shoot.<br />

		<span class="highlight">Can I bring my own music?</span><br />

		Yes, of course you can bring musicâ€”whatever puts you in the mood. We also have a selection of music at the studio.<br />

		<span class="highlight">Can I pay by credit card?</span><br />

		Currently, we accept credit cards for deposits only. The outstanding balance is due by check or cash on the day of your appointment.
